Crystal for Beginners

This archive contains code-like snippets automatically detected in the book “Crystal for Beginners”. Snippets are organized by chapter, with each snippet saved as a separate file.

File extensions are best-effort guesses:

.cr → Crystal code

.sh → Shell/terminal commands

.txt → General text that looked like code but could not be classified

Notes & Caveats

The extraction is heuristic: some non-code text may appear as code, or some code may be missed.

Snippets are grouped as they appeared in the document. Long examples may be split if formatting suggested a break.

If you notice misclassifications, feel free to rename the file extensions manually.
